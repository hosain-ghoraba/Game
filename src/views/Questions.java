    1- how to know the duration of any Effect ? I mean what value should I input to the constructor of Effect in the duration field? ( needed to implement the table in page 4 in M2 )
    2- in Dodge class, in apply method, should I typecast result speed to int or round it to the closest integer?
    3- in Embrace class, in apply method, should I typecast result values (currentHp, Mana, speed,attackDamage) to int or round it to the closest integer?
    4- in powerUp class, (same question, typecast or round?)
    5- important : what to do if the object carry multiple effects that does a percentage change on the same value,
                   and then one effect is removed, should the recovered percentage be calculated based on the 
                   the current value ?
    6 = can a champion carry multiple instances of the same Ability? ( this can happen if the champion was               
        carrying multiple disarm effects
        
    7- should reomve method work as the following : first, remove the first instance  
       of the removed effect from the appliedEffects ArrayList, then use that taken out effect by invoking 
       the remove method on it by reversing the logic? if this was how it works, it means that whenever 
       I want to remove say "Disarm" effect from a champion, I can make a new Instance of "Disarm" and 
       invoke the method on it? ( that new instance's only job is to find something to invoke the method 
       remove on).
