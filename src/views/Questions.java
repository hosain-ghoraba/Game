    2- in Dodge class, in apply method, should I typecast result speed to int or round it to the closest integer?
    3- in Embrace class, in apply method, should I typecast result values (currentHp, Mana, speed,attackDamage) to int or round it to the closest integer?

    5- important : what to do if the object carry multiple effects that does a percentage change on the same value,
                   and then one effect is removed, should the recovered percentage be calculated based on the 
                   the current value ?
