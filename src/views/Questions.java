    1- how to know the duration of any Effect ? I mean what value should I input to the constructor of Effect in the duration field? ( needed to implement the table in page 4 in M2 )
    2- in Dodge class, in apply method, should I typecast result speed to int or round it to the closest integer?
    3- in Embrace class, in apply method, should I typecast result values (currentHp, Mana, speed,attackDamage) to int or round it to the closest integer?
    4- in powerUp class, (same question, typecast or round?)
